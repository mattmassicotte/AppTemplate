# AppTemplate
A template for building apps with Xcode 

Getting set up to build apps in Xcode might seem easy, since it comes with templates. However, Xcode is complex and those templates don't always set things up as I'd like. So, I thought I'd share a slightly opinionated approach to structuring an Xcode project. This follows a similar pattern I've used for [packages](https://github.com/mattmassicotte/PackageTemplate).

By no means is this a one-size-fits-all kind of problem. Projects can be tremendously complex, with all kinds of different needs. But, I still think what's here is at least a good starting point. If you have ideas for ways to improve this, please open an issue or PR!

## Contributing and Collaboration

I'd love to hear from you! Get in touch via [mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@mattiem), an issue, or a pull request.

I prefer collaboration, and would love to find ways to work together if you have a similar project.

I prefer indentation with tabs for improved accessibility. But, I'd rather you use the system you want and make a PR than hesitate because of whitespace.
